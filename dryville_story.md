# The Story of Water in Dryville

## Introduction

Have you ever had the desire to strike out on your own? Maybe you've had enough of big-city life and want to build you own town way out in the unspoiled and unpopulated countryside? You might name it Dryville, since the only part of the country that is still so desolate is probably the desert!

Well, you can't begin your new town without considering water. From the smallest town to the biggest city, there always has to be a water plan. You need to be able to get water, use it, and dispose of what you don't want.

So let's say you made the big move. You and some friends have found your (desolate) spot and have moved in. How would you develop your "Water Plan for Dryville?"

## The Beginnings of Dryville

From the founding day of Dryville, you need water. Drinking water is your first priority, as well as water to bathe in, clean dishes and clothes, and to wash your hands after you've cleaned that possum you caught for supper. And, of course, a toilet will come in very, very handy. So, your first priority will be to find a SOURCE of water. The obvious source is the creek or pond nearby. Maybe you can hire a beaver to create a dam in the creek and create a [lake](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/lakes-and-reservoirs) (actually, a reservoir).

In your free time go ahead and start digging a hole in the ground for a [well](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/groundwater-wells). If you dig deep enough you might hit the [water table](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/aquifers-and-groundwater), where there will be standing water. You'll be able to lower a bucket down to get the available [groundwater](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/groundwater-what-groundwater). Things are starting out great -- you've already started using surface water (the creek and pond), ground water (your well), and you've even created your own water-storage system (the reservoir). So you now have a reliable source for your water needs. Time to relax? Not yet.

## Getting Water to Your Homes

Since you appointed yourself mayor Horace of Dryville, you naturally chose the best spot for your home â€” on top of the hill. Great view, but it sure is a pain lugging pails of water (at [over 8 pounds a gallon] (https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/water-density), your 100 gallons of water per day gets heavy in a hurry!) from the creek up the hill all day long. And now all your best buddies and neighbors are beginning to move in. Many of them are building on hills, too, so what you need now is a "water-supply distribution system" to get water to everyone's homes. The way to do this is to lay a system of pipes (which you make from clay from the creek bed) from the creek to each house.
